Advanced Stock Prediction Using LSTM
Project Overview
In this project, I built a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict the future stock prices of a given company. By leveraging technical indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and EMA, the model uses historical stock data to make predictions. I created this project to explore how deep learning can be applied to financial data for stock market forecasting. The model is built using Python, with popular libraries like TensorFlow, pandas, and yfinance to handle the data, build the model, and visualize the results.

Key Features
Download Historical Stock Data: Pulls data for any stock ticker from Yahoo Finance for a specified date range.

Technical Indicators: Uses indicators like RSI, MACD, EMA, and Bollinger Bands to enhance predictions.

LSTM Model: Implements a Bidirectional LSTM to predict future stock prices.

Future Price Prediction: Predicts the stock's price for the next 30 days.

Visualization: Plots actual prices, predicted prices, and future predictions in an easy-to-understand graph.

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow

Keras

Pandas

NumPy

yfinance (for data download)

TA-Lib (for calculating technical indicators)

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Scikit-learn (for data scaling)

How It Works
Download Stock Data: The first step involves downloading historical stock data using the yfinance library. You can specify the stock ticker (e.g., AAPL for Apple) and the date range.

Feature Engineering: The project calculates several technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), EMA (Exponential Moving Average), OBV (On-Balance Volume), and Bollinger Bands to enhance the prediction process. These are key indicators used by traders to make informed decisions.

Preprocessing Data: The data is scaled using MinMaxScaler to normalize values. A sliding window approach is applied to split the data into sequences (using the past 60 days of data to predict the next day's price).

LSTM Model: The data is fed into a Bidirectional LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle time series data. This model learns from the historical data and makes predictions.

Model Training: The model is trained for 20 epochs using EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.

Prediction: After training, the model predicts future stock prices, and the result is plotted alongside the actual historical prices.

Visualization: The final output includes a graph showing the stock's historical prices, predicted prices, and future predictions for the next 30 days.

Requirements
To run this project, you’ll need the following libraries:

TA-Lib: For technical analysis indicators

yfinance: For downloading stock data from Yahoo Finance

pandas: For data manipulation

NumPy: For numerical operations

matplotlib: For visualization

tensorflow: For building and training the LSTM model

scikit-learn: For scaling the data

You can install all the necessary packages by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install ta yfinance pandas numpy tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
To use the project, simply replace the ticker, start, and end dates in the example usage:

python
Copy
Edit
ticker = "AAPL"  # Change this to the stock you want to predict (e.g., MSFT, TSLA)
start = "2023-01-01"
end = "2024-01-01"
After setting up the ticker and date range, run the script, and it will:

Download the stock data

Train the LSTM model

Plot the historical data, predicted data, and future stock predictions

Example Output
The script will generate a plot with:

The actual stock prices (blue line)

The predicted prices from the LSTM model (orange line)

Future price predictions for the next 30 days (dashed line)


Future Enhancements
Here are a few ways this project could be improved:

Model Improvement: Experiment with different model architectures, including adding more LSTM layers or using different types of neural networks.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune hyperparameters like the learning rate and batch size to improve accuracy.

Multiple Stocks: Allow the prediction model to handle multiple stock tickers simultaneously.

Real-time Data: Incorporate live stock data to make real-time predictions using the model.

Conclusion
This project is a hands-on application of machine learning in the finance domain, specifically for stock market prediction. By using a Bidirectional LSTM and technical indicators, the model offers a robust method for forecasting future stock prices based on historical data. It’s an exciting starting point for anyone interested in the intersection of finance and deep learning.
